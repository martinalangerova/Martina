        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>An API, or <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>, is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.</p>
        <p>Think of it as a waiter at a restaurant. You (the user) tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter brings it to the kitchen (the server). Then, the waiter brings your food (the data) back to you.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Examples of APIs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Maps API:</strong> Used by websites and apps to show maps or get location data.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather API:</strong> Apps use this to get real-time weather information.</li>
            <li><strong>Twitter API:</strong> Allows apps to access and post tweets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why APIs are Important</h2>
        <p>APIs make it easier for software to share data and functionality. Instead of building everything from scratch, developers can use APIs to save time and focus on building new features.</p>
        <p>Without APIs, many of the apps and services we use every day wouldn't work together as smoothly as they do!</p>
